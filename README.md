# Getting Started with DuckDB

This repository provides the supporting code for my presentation entitled [Getting Started with DuckDB](https://www.catallaxyservices.com/presentations/getting-started-with-duckdb/).

## Running the Code

If you are running things locally, the `code\DuckDB_Examples.ipynb` notebook is the complete code base for this talk. I recommend creating a virtual environment for this project.

You will also need to download the data files for this demonstration. Links are available in the `data\DataLocations.txt` file. You should download the files to a folder called `\duckdbdata\`, at the same level as `\code\` and `\data\`.
