Demo 06 - Speech to Text
------------------------

- Start in the /code directory for this repo!
- Review the code in code\pages\2_Chat_with_Data.py
- Kick off the Streamlit app
    python -m streamlit run index.py --server.port 8080
- Ask the following questions, using the base GPT-4 model first and then schema-aware after that:
    - How many tables are there in the Tickets schema of this database?
    - How can I connect poverty rate and unemployment rate to data I'm querying from Tickets.Parking_Violations? Be sure to include any intermediary tables we will need to use for joins.
- Exit Streamlit from the console (Ctrl+C)
